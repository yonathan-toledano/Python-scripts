Python-Scripts

This repository contains basic Python scripts created as part of my assignments for the Intro to Python course at The Hebrew University.

These scripts cover fundamental Python topics such as mathematics, conditionals, loops, functions, and working with user input. They were written to practice core Python skills and demonstrate problem-solving.

🐍 Requirements

Python 3.7 (recommended)

Tested with standard Python libraries; no external modules required

Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

⚠️ Make sure you are using Python 3.7 or later to avoid compatibility issues.

📂 Scripts Overview
Script	Description
calculate_mathematical_expression.py	Calculates user-defined mathematical expressions and prints the result.
hello_turtle.py	Demonstrates basic drawing using Python's turtle module.
largest_and_smallest.py	Finds the largest and smallest numbers from user input.
math_print.py	Prints arithmetic results (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
quadratic_equation.py	Solves quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 and displays the roots.
shapes.py	Prints simple shapes (triangles, squares, etc.) using loops.
temperature.py	Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
⚙️ How to Run

Make sure Python 3.7 is installed and added to your PATH.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the script folder, for example:

cd Python-scripts


Run the script using Python:

python script_name.py


Replace script_name.py with the name of the script you want to execute.

📌 Notes

These scripts are educational and practice-oriented.

They focus on readability, simplicity, and learning fundamental Python concepts.

Each script contains comments explaining the code and logic.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add input validation to handle errors gracefully

Include more interactive scripts and games

Expand with file handling and data manipulation examples

Use Python modules to structure larger projects
